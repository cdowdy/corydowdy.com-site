    When I'm developing a website one of the development considerations I take into account among many is Website/Webpage
    performance. I want my site or the site I'm working on to load or look like its loaded as fast as possible with
    as few requests as possible. Slow loading websites are a pain the in ass for an end user. Slow rendering pages
    can make the difference of a visitor to your site using your service or moving on to one of your competitors.
    We don't want that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideally we want our sites to render in 1000ms (1 second!) &mdash; <a class="external-link" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM">Breaking the 1000ms Time to Glass Mobile Barrier <span class="link-icon icon-youtube"></span></a>.
    Yes you read that right 1 second. How do we get there though is the big question. Images followed by JavaScript
    and CSS tend to be the heaviest parts of webpages in respect to size and requests so that seems like the logical
    spot to start our optimizations.

  <h2 class="heading">Getting Started: A baseline</h2>
  <p>
    Before implementing any of the web performance best practices it's best to have a baseline of what your site
    currently "scores" and how heavy your images may or may not be. Luckily there isn't a shortage of tools to use
    to get this baseline.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a></td>
      <td>Enter your domain name and select <em>Analyze</em>. There is also Firefox and Chrome Extensions
        Available <a  href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights_extensions">Extensions</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://gtmetrix.com/">GTMetrix</a></td>
      <td>Enter your domain name and select <em>Go</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom Tools Website Speed Test</a></td>
      <td>Enter your domain and select <em>Test Now</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">Yahoo YSlow</a></td>
      <td>This is a browser extension/bookmarklet and command line/terminal tool.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/">Sitespeed.io</a></td>
      <td>Command Line/Terminal tool. Produces a lot of information on your site. Extremely handy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">Webpagetest.org</a></td>
      <td>Everyone should use Webpagetest. Will test mobile/desktop and multitude of browsers.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    In addition to those above mentioned tools there are copious amounts of browser extensions to use. One of the
    better ones is the Web Developer Toolbar
    <a class="external-link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm?hl=en-US">Chrome Version <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    &ndash; <a class="external-link" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/">FireFox Version <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have your baseline from any of the above services we can move on to the nuts and bolts of actually
    speeding up our site. Throughout this post I'll be working on a page from my site
    ( <a href="https://corydowdy.com/demos">corydowdy.com/demos</a> ) that has already had some of the best practices
    applied and is using <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module">Google's Mod_PageSpeed <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a> Apache Module.
  </p>
  <p class="image-lightbox">
    The baseline I'll be using is split into two parts. One with PageSpeed Module turned off on <a title="before desktop" href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/desktop-no-PS.png">desktop <span class="link-icon icon-picture"></span></a>
    and off on <a title="before mobile" href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/mobile-no-PS.png">mobile <span class="link-icon icon-picture"></span></a>.
    The other with PageSpeed service on for the <a title="PageSpeed desktop" href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/desktop-PS.png">desktop <span class="link-icon icon-picture"></span></a>
    and <a title="PageSpeed Mobile" href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/mobile-PS.png">mobile <span class="link-icon icon-picture"></span></a>
    devices which you can see causes a few issues that I'll fix further on down. Your website will more than likely
    have only one baseline to go from.

<section id="img-opti">
  <h2 class="heading">Image Optimization</h2>
  <p>
    Images, as I said earlier, are usually the heaviest and biggest components in our web pages / web sites. So
    making these smaller can give us huge gains. Particularly when choosing the right image format. Some quick and
    dirty rules on choosing the correct image format.
  </p>
  <ul class="no-bullet">
    <li>If its a Photo &rarr; JPEG</li>
    <li>If its a Logo, Line Art &rarr; SVG</li>
    <li>If its a graphic with multiple colors &rarr; PNG over GIF (PNG better compression)</li>
    <li>If its a long animation &rarr; use <code class="language-markup">&lt;video&gt;</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Those rules are quick and dirty because not every browser supports SVG and I left out one of my newer favorite
    formats - <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?csw=1">WebP <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Image optimization tools are a plenty. Addy Osmani has a great post on
    <a class="external-link" href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/image-optimization-tools/">Image Optimization Tools <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    that gathers many of the desktop and browser based tools to optimize images. If you're not into grunt / gulp or
    any of the other JavaScript task runners and are able to install server modules I highly recommend taking
    advantage of <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module">mod_pagespeed <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
    It will optimize your images and convert them to many formats including to WebP for supported browsers.
    If you're not in the position to install server modules then you may want to look at the
    <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service">PageSpeed Service <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
  </p>
  <p class="image-lightbox">
    Another way to get an optimized image is to use Google's PageSpeed Chrome extension. Open up the DevTools Panel
    (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>cmd+opt+i</kbd> Mac ) and navigate to the
    PageSpeed tab (baring that you have the pagespeed extension listed up top installed). Select Analyze. If you have
    images that can be optimized they will be listed under the "Optimize Images" suggestion. You may then click the
    "<a title="PageSpeed Image Optimization" href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/pagespeed-image-opti.jpg">see optimized content <span class="link-icon icon-picture"></span></a>"
    link. Open for each image and save to your image directory. This can be a cumbersome process so the use one of
    the previously mentioned tools can be extremely helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final piece to the image optimization puzzle is responsive images. Recently the
    <a class="external-link" href="https://responsiveimages.org/">Responsive Images Community Group (RICG) <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    put together a proposal for responsive images. Their work produced the picture element and the srcset element.
    You can use these elements today (even in browsers like Internet Explorer!) by taking advantage of the
    Filament Group's <a class="external-link" href="http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/">PictureFill <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    polyfill.

<section id="compression">
  <h2 class="heading">Compression</h2>
  <p>
    Enabling compression can be different depending on your server you host your site on. The simplest way to do it
    is to head over to the <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs">HTML5 boilerplate server configs section on github  <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
    The section labeled under <em>Web Performance</em> has Expires headers and enables compression for you. Drop
    that into your web root and you're good to go. Example of the Apache specific lines I'm talking about can be
    found on lines <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/dist/.htaccess#L709-L984">709-984<span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.

<section id="min-requests">
  <h2 class="heading">Minimize Requests</h2>
  <p>
    My Demos page has four (4) CSS files and six (6) JavaScript files loaded externally and two images inside
    an <code class="language-markup">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. This may seem like a lot of JavaScript to some people
    and not many to others. Since my normal work flow uses Grunt unCSS I separate my individual component CSS
    (navigation plug ins etc) in order to keep dynamically created css from breaking after the uncss task. A sample of
    that work flow can be found
    <a class="external-link" href="https://corydowdy.com/blog/foundation-5-sass-and-grunt-uncss">here <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span>.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    As I mentioned before I use Grunt in my work flow. You don't have to use any task runner. None at all. This is
    strictly my preference. It makes things easier for me but each persons workflow is different so don't paint yourself
    into a corner thinking you <strong>NEED</strong> to use a task runner. For those who do not use a task runner like
    Grunt here are some other tools you can use to concatenate and minify your JavaScript files and minify and combine
    your CSS files.

    <li><a class="external-link" href="http://mixture.io/">Mixture.io (Cross Platform)</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To minimize my request size I'll use <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin">grunt-contrib-cssmin <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    to minify and combine my css files and <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat">grunt-contrib-concat <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    and <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify">uglify <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    to minify and combine my JavaScript files. I'll install these to my project files in one command.
  </p>
  <pre class="language-bash"><code>npm install grunt-contrib-cssmin grunt-contrib-concat grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev</code></pre>

  <p>
    Once those are installed I'll move on to the Gruntfile and setup which CSS files I want combined and the Javascript
    files I want to combine and uglify (minify) paying close attention to their order. I don't want a JavaScript
    plug-in dependent on JQuery being loaded after JQuery.
  </p>
  <p>
    An example Gruntfile follows:
  </p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
  // cssmin setup
  cssmin: {
    combine: {
      files: {
        // File to create      CSS Files I want to combine and minify
        'css/app.min.css': ['css/demo.css', 'css/demo-menu.css','css/another-demo.css', 'css/demo-3.css']
      }
    }
  },

  // concat and uglify setup
  concat: {
    options: {
      separator: ';'
    },
    basic: {
      // javascript files I want to combine
      src: ['jquery.js','js-1.js','js-2.js','js-3.js', 'js-4.js', 'js-5.js'],
      // The Resulting JavaScript I want to create
      dest: 'js/min/cd-demos.comb.js'
    }
  },
  uglify: {
    options: {
      // the banner is inserted at the top of the output
      banner: '/*! &lt;%= pkg.name %&gt; &lt;%= grunt.template.today("dd-mm-yyyy") %&gt; */\n',
      compress: {
        drop_console: true
      }
    },
    dist: {
      files: {
        'js/min/&lt;%= pkg.name %&gt;-demos.min.js' : ['js/min/cd-demos.comb.js']
      }
    }
  },
</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    After setting up the files I want grunt to create and use we can move on to enabling the task and registering
    them so we can run them from our terminal.
  </p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-cssmin');
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-concat');
</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    You can register a grunt task that will combine any of the plugins you installed to run at once. Since I'm using
    Sass I'll create a build task to compile my Scss to CSS, combine the separate component CSS files then minify it.
    The JavaScript task will concat the multiple JS files then uglify them.
  </p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
  grunt.registerTask( 'build', ['sass', 'cssmin'] );
  grunt.registerTask( 'buildjs', ['concat', 'uglify'] );
</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    When you register a task it allows you to call it from your command line. For instance if I were to
    type <code class="language-bash"> grunt build </code> it will run grunt-sass and grunt-contrib-cssmin on the
    targets I specified in my Gruntfile. Same goes for the task I called <em>buildjs</em> above. By doing the above I
    have reduced my CSS and JavaScript requests from ten (10) to two (2).

<section id="inlinedcss">
  <h2 class="heading">Inline Critical CSS</h2>
  <p>
    Inlining CSS is simple if you have very small css file (14 kb or so) but it too comes with some warnings. You will
    save a trip to the server to get your CSS (good!) but you will lose out on it being able to be cached. To inline
    CSS copy the small css into a <code class="language-markkup">&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in your head.
  </p>
<pre class="language-markup">
  <code>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html class="no-js" lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Inline CSS&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      header {
      /* header styles */
      }
      nav {
      /* menu styles */
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="logo.svg" alt="logo" &gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
  <p>
    You may notice there is no <code class="language-markup"> &lt;link&gt; </code> tag containing a CSS file. Link
    tags will block painting of the web page which will slow down rendering. Few ways to combat this are outlined at
    <a class="external-link" href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2012/make-your-mobile-pages-render-in-under-one-second/">Make Mobile Pages Render in Under 1 Second <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    and <a class="external-link" href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulIrish/posts/Ahn8VkC36nM">loading stylesheets without blocking painting <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
    Currently my favorite way to load stylesheets async is <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS">loadCSS</a>
    by the Filament Group. You may choose to skip all that and just plop your css link in your head. This comes down to
    your performance "budget" and how much time and knowledge you're willing to spend.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you page is small and your not dealing with responsive design you can just plug the css needed to render the
    "above the fold" content on the first request like we did above. If you're not in that position but you have a
    VPS/Dedicated Server or your hosting provider allows you to install modules then save yourself some hair pulling
    and a lot of work and install Mod_PageSpeed. Once PageSpeed is installed you can inline css by enabling the
    <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-css-inline">inline_css <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    filter. To Prioritize Critical CSS with Mod_PageSpeed you can enable the
    <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-prioritize-critical-css">prioritize_critical_css <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    filter. Mod_PageSpeed really is worth installing and that good!

    For those not fortunate to have Mod_PagSpeed Paul Kinlan, a Chrome Developer Advocate, has created a JavaScript
    snippet to find the above the fold content in his post

  </p>
  <h3 class="heading">Update: 6/10/2014</h3>
  <p>
    Above I mentioned just "dropping" in a small stylesheet into your head inside style tags. This can and will work
    but in regards to RWD (Resposive Web Design) we have these things called media queries. As a developer we don't
    know anything about the users screen size. Is it mobile device? What is considered above the fold (how "tall" the
    screen is)? Scott Jehl (<a class="external_link" href="https://twitter.com/scottjehl">@scottjehl</a>) suggests instead
    of thinking "mobile first" that if you're going to inline or "embed" css that we should start thinking "global first".

  <p>
    The CSS that you can, or rather should, inline/embed into the head is the CSS that will render a usable page on
    any and all devices (think text styling, basic page structure etc). Then you can load the "enhanced" or rest of the
    css to fully render your page. Keeping in mind that the inlined CSS portion should be small and able to be fetched
    in the first round trip to your server.

  <h2 class="heading">Render Blocking JS</h2>
  <p>
    To avoid Render Blocking JavaScript we can do two things with minimal work. Either add the "defer" attribute to your script
    tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="1.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code> or the "async" attribute
    to your script tags <code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="1.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code>. Defer
    works by waiting till <strong>After</strong> the HTML parser is finished. Async works by letting HTML parsing to
    continue and then load the scripts whenever they are ready. Both of these methods do not take into account script order
    so dependencies may be loaded after the script they are dependent on. Another way to load scripts in a non blocking
    manner is to use a script loader such as <a class="external-link" href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    which can seem and be a little bit complicated. &mdash;<em>YO, YOU NEED TO LOAD JAVASCRIPT...HERE'S SOME JAVASCRIPT TO LOAD YOUR
    JAVASCRIPT!!!</em> &mdash;. If you'd rather skip the sometimes very complicated world of script loading take a look
    at Mod_PageSpeed and enabled the <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-js-defer">defer_javascript <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    filter.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're doing any JavaScript modifications as the page loads this may cause problems. So make sure you test in a dev
    environment before deploying. Ilya Grigorik says <a class="external-link" href="https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/20/script-injected-async-scripts-considered-harmful/">Async is ready for every browser <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    due to preloading scanners and has a few things to consider at the end of his post. He also suggest removing
    <em>defer</em> altogether in preference to async. To support older browsers that do not recognize <em>async</em>
    he suggest adding defer also like so:
  </p>
  <div class="snippet">
<pre>
<code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="https://example.com/your-funky-js.js" async defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
</pre>

  <h3 class="heading">Update: 7/10/2014</h3>
  <p>
    The Filament Group, in all their awesome ways, has released a function to load your JavaScript in a non-blocking
    manner called <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS">loadJS <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
    This is extremely useful and I am in the process of converting my sites to it currently.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can couple this function along with their loadCSS function which they have already done for you and it is called
    <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/enhance">Enhance Js <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>.
    This file should be inlined in your head. It allows for the loading of webfonts, CSS, and JavaScript in a non-blocking
    fashion. It also includes a cookie function to remove inlined CSS after a return visit in favor of the cached version
    that is loaded async.

    I've done all the above and then some to optimize my site. In fact some of my pages (as of this writing it may
    change :) ) score 98 to 99 in Google PageSpeed Insights. My Demos page isn't as lucky.

    I can immediately improve this score by taking the two svg's inside the image tag and inlining them either as an
    inline <code class="language-markup">&lt;svg&gt;</code> or as a data uri. I'll first run the SVG I'm using on my
    page through <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-svgmin">grunt svgmin <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    which will remove some of the fluff generated from Adobe Illustrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Popping in an inline SVG is easy but you have to do it with a few caveats. Chrome adds weird padding above and
    below the SVG. I fixed that with this <a class="external-link" href="https://gist.github.com/cdowdy/3472dac171a0ceaf1120#file-chrome-inline-svg-fix">Gist <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    and removing the width and height properties from the SVG and replacing them with 100% in each one which allows the
    SVG to take up the entire width and height of its container. If you want more control over the size you can control
    it through CSS or setting it in it's "viewBox" attribute. You may choose to give it a class name (recommended). I
    just kept it as SVG since I'm not doing any other CSS modification to any other SVG's. You also have to take into
    account your sites analytics and making sure your visitors browsers can handle inline SVG.

    of Mod_Pagespeed and inlining my SVG are pretty great. On a return or repeat view of the site all Critical Path
    CSS is inlined along with any small css files I may have included. This is because mod_pagespeed with the
    "inline_css" and "inline_critical_css" filters enabled will post a beacon back to my server with the height of the
    users screen. This enables mod_pagespeed to then gather all the css selectors used in the "above the fold" content,
    inline those and lazy load the remaining CSS for every view after the initial view.

    There still is a "Consider Fixing" suggestion of Leverage Browser Caching. That happens to be a suggestion of
    extending the cache time of my Typekit script. The cache time is pretty low on it and I can't seem to find anywhere
    on how to extend it so it will have to stay.

    Start off small for optimizing your website but at the very least please enable compression and run your images
    through an image optimizer. If you don't want to go through the process of optimizing your site, or your budget
    doesn't allot for optimization (it should be a design choice like anything else) at the least install Mod_Pagespeed.
    It's a great module that not only does the things mentioned in this post but has filters that can help Optimize
    Caching, Minimize Round Trip times, Minimize Request Overhead, Minimize Payload Size and Optimize Rendering. All
    those filters can be found at
    <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters">PageSpeed Filters <span class="link-icon icon-external-link"></span></a>
    page for the module.
